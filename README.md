# google-docs-linker

This script is currently not published as a Google Drive add-on, so cannot be easily consumed for re-use. I have published the code here so that you can use it for your own scripts.

## How to use in a document

1. Open a Google Document
1. Go to *Tools* -> *Script Editor*
1. Paste the contents of [Code.gs](Code.gs) into the editor
1. Click *Save*
1. Click *Run*

## Limitations

* I haven't figured out yet how to use it for all of your Google documents
* I think the script needs to be adapted for Google sheets (e.g. they have no body)
